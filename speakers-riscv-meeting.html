<h2 id="K-LABARTA">The Accelerator Tile of European Processor Initiative</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.computer.org/profiles/jesus-labarta">Jesus Labarta</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project aims at developing European processor technology for High Performance Computing (HPC) and emerging application areas. An important objective of the project is to develop a fully owned implementation of accelerators based on RISC-V cores. The resulting EPAC architecture integrates generic RISC-V vector cores plus other more specialized accelerator component (STX) also based on RISC-V targeting AI and stencil kernels acceleration plus a RISC-V processor (VRP) with support for variable and high precision arithmetic.</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the fundamental vision behind the design and the overall resulting architecture. The project has produced a test chip in GF 22 nm technology, featuring 4 vector cores, 2 STX clusters and one VRP processor. In parallel, an FPGA implementation of the vector core and memory subsystem has been implemented to be used as a software development vehicle (SDV), continuous integration (CI) and co-design support infrastructure. This system runs as stand alone self hosted Linux node where general purpose application from the HPC but also other domains can be run. I will report some initial results of these evaluations and comparisons to other state of the art architectures.</p>

<p><a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is a system for digital architecture design (FPGA, ASIC), which generates traditional HDL (VHDL, Verilog) from a high level, functional specification written in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Haskell</a>. A design can be fully developed and tested in software, while at the same time offering full control over detailed hardware issues. It has several features, such as higher order functions, domain specific embedded languages, polymorphism. In particular the typing system is very helpful in verification, including time domain crossings and synchronization. Last but not least, a design process in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is fundamentally model based, meaning that all design steps, starting from an initial model, are expressed in the same language, and the correctness of each step is provable. During the talk we will illustrate some of these aspects by examples.</p>

<h2 id="P-BARTOLINI">RISC-V based Power Management Unit for an HPC processor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Andrea Bartolini</strong> (<a href="https://dei.unibo.it/en/department">Università di Bologna</a>) and <strong>Alessandro Ottaviano</strong> (ETHZ).</p>
<p>High-Performance Computing (HPC) processors are nowadays integrated Cyber-Physical Systems, which require Power Controller Subsystems (PCS) to provide advanced multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) dynamic control of operating points to meet energy, power and thermal constraints. In the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a>, a PCS IP has been designed to extend the <a href="https://pulp-platform.org">PULP platform</a> to comply with the industrial standards adopted in the HPC segment for on-chip, off-chip power management. The SoC is named PULPcontroller and features a fully-digital and highly capable RISC-V based parallel microcontroller IP optimized for power management of complex HPC processors. Its design supports a manager core and peripherals paired with a cluster of 8 processors to accelerate the Power Control Firmware workload, Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine for accessing on-chip sensors, a uDMA engine for off-chip AVSBUS/PMBUS peripheral support and BMC-based communication through the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP). The controller implements basic System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) doorbell-based protocol hosting up to 144 external interrupt lines. On the software side, it relies on an open-source Real-time Operating System (<a href="https://www.freertos.org">FreeRTOS</a>) for agile scheduling of the underlying Control Policy and interface handling. The presentation will describe the power management problem, requirements, and the ControlPULP design and performance.</p>

<h2 id="P-FERRER">SW Toolchain for RISC-V Vector Extensions</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://rofi.roger-ferrer.org/">Roger Ferrer</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>The RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) provides vector capabilities to the RISC-V ecosystem. It does this by providing a very flexible and rich ISA which features vector length and masking support. This flexibility comes with some challenges in implementing it in compilers. In this talk we will see how we tackled these issues in the context of the EPI project, which ideas were ultimately implemented in upstream LLVM and which didn't. With code generation well understood now, the focus shifts on how to make good use of the extension in the compiler via vectorization. We will see the ongoing work in the LLVM Loop Vectorizer, what is there and what is still missing.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://rofi.roger-ferrer.org">Roger Ferrer Ibanez</a> is a research engineer at the <a href="https://www.bsc.es">Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)</a> who works on compilers. In the past he worked in enabling the parallel programming research in task based models at BSC. While he is still participating on this, these days most of his work revolves about enabling support for the RISC-V vector extension in LLVM in the context of the EPI, MEEP and EUPILOT projects.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-FUGUET">VRP: VaRiable Precision RISC-V Accelerator for High-Precision</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-fuguet-tortolero-9769a21b">César Fuguet-Tortolero</a></strong> (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA</a>).</p>
<p>Algebraic linear solvers and eigensolvers are ubiquitous in several scientific domains such as structure calculations, fluidics or finite elements. For this reason, they are proposed in mature standard and commercial libraries. Projective methods are the most popular methods for implementing both linear solvers and eigensolvers because of their scalable memory cost O(N). However, these methods are highly sensitive to numerical stability. The use of high precision (more than 128 bits) floating-point computation increases this stability and reduces the number of iterations. Current proposals for implementing high-precision computation consist in software emulation, which exhibits poor performance.</p>
<p>The CEA-List proposal is a hardware accelerator for high-precision computing. We developed the hardware VaRiable Precision (VRP) RISC-V accelerator that operates on floating-point numbers with up to 512 bits of significand and 18 bits of exponent. Both software and hardware topics will be discussed during the presentation.</p>
<p>Work on this accelerator has been founded first by the French Research National Agency (ANR) in the framework of the <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-18-CE46-0011">IMPRENUM</a> project, and then by the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project. A first silicon prototype was implemented using the GF22FDX technology during the first phase of the EPI project, and new optimized silicon/FPGA prototypes are being developed during the second phase of this project.</p>
<p><em>PhD. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-fuguet-tortolero-9769a21b">César Fuguet-Tortolero</a> joined CEA, Grenoble, France, in 2015. He is a researcher in the Laboratory of Systems-on-Chip and Advanced Technologies (LSTA) of the <a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA List institute</a>. He contributes to the High Performance Computing (HPC) team and currently leads the team in charge of the Variable Precision accelerator for the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project.

<h2 id="P-JAN">Formal Processor Modeling for Analyzing Safety and Security Properties on RISC-V case studies</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-jan-243a4919/">Mathieu Jan</a></strong> (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA</a>).</p>
<p>The emergence of open hardware initiatives, for instance based on the RISC-V ISA, exposes more easily the exact behavior of hardware designs. They can then be analyzed and combined with application-level semantics to formally verify complex safety and security properties at system level, in particular by integrating non-functional characteristics such as timing. This is the goal of the the LEAF approach developped at CEA, which currently focuses, on one hand, on timing predictability &amp; memory contention evaluations required by safety-critical systems, and on the other hand on assessments of fault-injection attacks over secured embedded systems. In this talk, we first briefly present an overview of LEAF. Then, we focus on our current results over several RISC-V case studies for: 1) fault-injection assessment, i.e. the CV32E40P processor from the <a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org">OpenHW Group</a>, and 2) the automatic construction of pipeline datapaths from high-level HDL code (RISC-V mini, Sodor, KyogenRV, Rocket).</p>
<p><em>Dr <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/j/MathieuJan.html">Mathieu Jan</a> obtained his engineer diploma in 2003 and got a PhD in 2006 on the subject of management of data on grid architectures in an INRIA laboratory (Rennes). He joined the laboratory of Embedded Real-Time Systems Laboratory at “Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique” (the French DoE) in 2007. His main research interests are around real-time and embedded systems (network on chip, scheduling, mapping, low-power, formal modeling and verification). He is senior expert on these subjects at CEA Tech since 2014, he obtained an Habilitation à Diriger des Recherche (HDR) in 2016 and is a CEA Research Director since 2021. He is member of the various program committees, such as the International Real-Time and Network Systems (RTNS) conference, has co-advised 5 PhD thesis and is the director of 4 on-going PhD thesis. He spent the whole year 2019 as visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in the group of Prof. Edward Lee. Since 2020 Mathieu is leading a research team on the hardware/software formal verification of CPS systems.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-MINERVINI">Vitruvius: An Area-Efficient RISC-V Decoupled Vector Accelerator for High Performance Computing</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-minervini-a30998153">Francesco Minervini</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>The availability of domain-specific instruction set extensions, like vector processing, make RISC-V a good candidate for supporting the integration of specialized hardware in processor cores. This talk presents Vitruvius, the first RISC-V vector accelerator developed at BSC for the Supercomputing domain, as part of the EPI project. Vitruvius implements the RISC-V vector extension specification V0.7.1. and can be easily connected to a scalar core using the Open Vector Interface (OVI) standard in a plug-and-play fashion. Vitruvius natively supports long vectors: 256 Double Precision (DP) floating-point elements in a single vector instruction. It is composed of a set of identical vector pipelines (lanes), each containing a slice of the Vector Register File (VRF) and functional units (one integer, one floating-point). It adopts a novel hybrid in-order/out-of-order execution scheme, supported by vector register renaming and arithmetic/memory instruction decoupling. When configured with eight vector lanes, Vitruvius reaches a maximum frequency of 1.25 GHz when synthesized using GLOBALFOUNDRIES 22FDX FD-SOI. The silicon implementation has a total area of 1.13 mm2 and total estimated power around 1W.</p>

This is often synonym to long delays and high implementation efforts when trying to make overall decisions regarding the flavor of a new architecture. This talk introduces Coyote, an open-source, execution-driven simulator based on Spike and Sparta, with a focus on the movement of data throughtout the modeled system. This focus strikes a balance between fidelity and simulation throughput, enabling reasoning on the RISC-V based HPC architectures of tomorrow.</p>
