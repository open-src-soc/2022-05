        <h1 id="SPEAKERS-03-may">Speakers of The <em>4th RISC-V Meeting</em></h1>
<h2 id="P-CLERMIDY">Welcome Address from the IRT Nanoelec</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-clermidy-9452602/">Fabien Clermidy</a></strong> (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA</a>, <a href="https://irtnanoelec.fr">Nanoelec, a French Technological Research institute</a>).</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-clermidy-9452602/">Fabien Clermidy</a> is currently heading the digital architecture and IC design department in the research technology division of CEA. In this position, he develops the hardware and software computing strategy for High-Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Cyber-Physical-Systems in relation with system developments in automotive, factory of future, avionics or defense and new nanotechnologies such as 3D chip-stacking, embedded Non-Volatile-Memories, photonic and quantum computing. Fabien has been working in CEA since 2000, holding different positions as project leader and manager of different teams. He is also a senior expert with a Ph’D supervisor degree and has published more than 80 papers in the greatest conferences such as ISSCC or DAC.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-KUPER">Digital hardware design with Clash</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-kuper-15bab311">Jan Kuper</a></strong> (<a href="https://qbaylogic.com">QBayLogic</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is a system for digital architecture design (FPGA, ASIC), which generates traditional HDL (VHDL, Verilog) from a high level, functional specification written in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Haskell</a>. A design can be fully developed and tested in software, while at the same time offering full control over detailed hardware issues. It has several features, such as higher order functions, domain specific embedded languages, polymorphism. In particular the typing system is very helpful in verification, including time domain crossings and synchronization. Last but not least, a design process in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is fundamentally model based, meaning that all design steps, starting from an initial model, are expressed in the same language, and the correctness of each step is provable. During the talk we will illustrate some of these aspects by examples.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-kuper-15bab311">Jan Kuper</a> studied mathematics and logic, and holds a PhD in the foundations of mathematics and computer science. For more than 30 years he worked at the University of Twente in the fields of logic, functional programming, and embedded systems. His research led to the development of Clash, and in 2016 he founded (together with Christiaan Baaij) the company <a href="https://qbaylogic.com">QBayLogic</a> which offers services in FPGA design using <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-CAVALCANTE">The RISC-V based Stencil Tensor Accelerator of EPI</h2>
<p>By <strong>Matheus Cavalcante</strong> (ETHZ).</p>
<p><em>Matheus Cavalcante received his MSc degree in integrated electronic systems from the Grenoble Institute of Technology (Phelma) in 2018. He is currently pursuing a PhD degree in the Digital Circuits and Systems group of Prof. Benini. His research interests include vector processing and high-performance computer architectures.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-FUGUET">VRP: VaRiable Precision RISC-V Accelerator for High-Precision</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-fuguet-tortolero-9769a21b">César Fuguet-Tortolero</a></strong> (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA</a>).</p>
<p>Algebraic linear solvers and eigensolvers are ubiquitous in several scientific domains such as structure calculations, fluidics or finite elements. For this reason, they are proposed in mature standard and commercial libraries. Projective methods are the most popular methods for implementing both linear solvers and eigensolvers because of their scalable memory cost O(N). However, these methods are highly sensitive to numerical stability. The use of high precision (more than 128 bits) floating-point computation increases this stability and reduces the number of iterations. Current proposals for implementing high-precision computation consist in software emulation, which exhibits poor performance.</p>
<p>The CEA-List proposal is a hardware accelerator for high-precision computing. We developed the hardware VaRiable Precision (VRP) RISC-V accelerator that operates on floating-point numbers with up to 512 bits of significand and 18 bits of exponent. Both software and hardware topics will be discussed during the presentation.</p>
<p>Work on this accelerator has been founded first by the French Research National Agency (ANR) in the framework of the <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-18-CE46-0011">IMPRENUM</a> project, and then by the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project. A first silicon prototype was implemented using the GF22FDX technology during the first phase of the EPI project, and new optimized silicon/FPGA prototypes are being developed during the second phase of this project.</p>
<p><em>PhD. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-fuguet-tortolero-9769a21b">César Fuguet-Tortolero</a> joined CEA, Grenoble, France, in 2015. He is a researcher in the Laboratory of Systems-on-Chip and Advanced Technologies (LSTA) of the <a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA List institute</a>. He contributes to the High Performance Computing (HPC) team and currently leads the team in charge of the Variable Precision accelerator for the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project. His research topics include multi/many-core architectures, memory hierarchy, cache coherency and integration of heterogeneous accelerators for the HPC domain.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-BARTOLINI">RISC-V based Power Management Unit for an HPC processor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Andrea Bartolini</strong> (ETHZ).</p>
<p><em>Andrea Bartolini holds an assistant professor (RTD-B) position at the University of Bologna. He is an active researcher in the domain of power and thermal management in a wide range of computing systems. In this field he has published more than won the Best Paper Award in DATE 2013, the Best IP Paper Award in DATE 2014 Conferences, and the Gauss Award at ISC 2016. He has published more than 85 papers in international peer-reviewed conferences and journals. He has collaborated with several international research and companies. Andrea Bartolini has been the main responsible for the design of advance power management and monitoring support on the first Cavium ThunderX cluster and on the D.A.V.I.D.E. system today ranked on the top20 most energy efficient supercomputers worldwide.</em></p>
