<h2 id="K-HEISER">Keynote – seL4 and RISC-V: Taking security to the next level</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/people/index.html%3fcn=Gernot+Heiser">Gernot Heiser</a></strong> (<a href="https://unsw.edu.au">UNSW Syndey</a> and <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au">Data61, CSIRO</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-09h00-Gernot-Heiser.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Security of computer systems is a persistent problem, with mainstream operating systems having thousands of hidden vulnerabilities resulting from implementation bugs, and new attacks discovered all the time. Recent attacks, such as <a href="https://meltdownattack.com">Spectre</a>, show that the problem is even worse than classic software bugs, demonstrating that information leakage through timing channels is a mainstream threat. The <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4 microkernel</a> was the first operating system kernel with a formal, machine-checked proof of functional correctness of the implementation, demonstrating that bug-free software is possible. Follow-up research has extended this to proofs of security enforcement down to the binary, and demonstrations that seL4 can protect real-world systems from attacks. I will explain seL4 and its verification story, which was recently extended to the RISC-V architecture. I will then cover our current research on time protection, the principled prevention of timing channels. I show how all Intel and ARM processors we examined exhibit timing channels that are impossible to close, calling for improved hardware support. We have subsequently shown that an exisiting open-source RISC-V core can be easily extended to provide such support at low cost, making that core the first processor on which the OS can prevent timing channels. We are working with the RISC-V community on getting the required mechanism standardised, while concurrently working on formally verifying our prevention mechanisms. At least one company is in the process of producing chips that support our mechanisms, a great demonstration of the power of an open architecture with open-source implementations.</p>

<p>Numerous timing side-channels attacks have been proposed in recent years, showing that all shared states inside the CPU microarchitecture are potential threats. Any hardware protection against these threats requires to slightly modify the instruction set architecture (ISA), to communicate the security constraints from the software to the hardware. In this presentation, we will see how the RISC-V ISA can be modified to tackle the problem from first principles, and what the impact is on both hardware and software sides. A new open benchmark measuring timing leakages will also be introduced, making it possible to assess the vulnerability of systems and the effectiveness of implemented mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="P-HISCOCK">Leveraging the LLVM framework and memory encryption to provide low overhead runtime pointer integrity checking</h2>
<p>By <strong>Thomas Hiscock</strong>, Olivier Savry (<a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr">Univ. Grenoble Alpes</a>, <a href="https://www.leti-cea.fr">CEA LETI</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-10h15-Thomas-Hiscock.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Memory safety problems (buffer overflows, use-after-free) are the root cause of most security issues in today’s programs. Most of these programs are written in <em>unsafe</em> languages (C, C++), which allow raw pointers manipulation. Fortunately, <em>safe</em> languages (Rust, Ada) are getting more and more adoption in the industry, which definitely reduces the number of vulnerabilities. However, these languages would usually only provide guarantees at compile-time, under a perfect execution model. What would happen if a clock glitch is injected on the circuit and a stack variable copy instruction is skipped? It could definitely lead to a buffer overflow. In this talk, we will present a countermeasure that provides run-time pointer integrity verification. It builds on top of a memory encryption and integrity scheme and some code instrumentation that we implemented in the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> compiler. Aside from the countermeasure, we will present our validation framework and some performance results.</p>

<h2 id="P-ROKICKI">Mitigating Spectre Attacks on a RISC-V DBT-Based Processor</h2>
<p>By <strong>Simon Rokicki</strong> (<a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr">Univ. Rennes</a>, <a href="https://inria.fr">INRIA</a>, <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr">CNRS</a>, <a href="https://www.irisa.fr">IRISA</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-10h30-Simon-Rokicki.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Unveiled early 2018, the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com">Spectre</a> vulnerability affects most of the modern high-performance processors. Spectre variants exploit the speculative execution mechanisms and a cache side-channel attack to leak secret data. As of today, the main countermeasures consist of turning off the speculation, which drastically reduces the processor performance. In this work, we focus on a different kind of micro-architecture: the DBT based processors, such as <a href="https://github.com/srokicki/HybridDBT">Hybrid-DBT</a>, which is capable of executing RISC-V binaries on a VLIW architecture. Instead of using complex out-of-order (OoO) mechanisms, this core combines a software Dynamic Binary Translation mechanism (DBT) and a parallel in-order architecture. The DBT is in charge of translating and optimizing the binaries before their execution. Studies show that DBT based processors can reach the performance level of OoO cores for regular enough applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that, even if those processors do not use OoO execution, they are still vulnerable to Spectre variants, because of the DBT optimizations. However, we also demonstrate that those systems can easily be patched, as the DBT is done in software and has fine-grained control over the optimization process.</p>

(<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-11h15-Lucilla-Sioli.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>There is a clear and increasing interest for open source hardware and RISC-V solutions in Europe. It is important to have an alternative processor ecosystem due to various reasons like uncertainty about established processor IP providers, geopolitical considerations, creation of healthy competition in processor IP, etc. From a European perspective, there is a need to help further the creation of a European ecosystem around open source hardware addressing all performance ranges and including software and tools. The talk will provide an overview of the bigger picture with forthcoming European initiatives in processors and semiconductor technologies as well as more specific information about open source hardware activities.</p>

(<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-12h00-Pierre-Sel.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Mainland China has become the main market for semiconductors, attracting companies, talents and IP to the country. With the so-called “War on Huawei”, the Chinese government doubled down on independent innovation and mastery of the key technologies. In particular, it is crucial for China to emancipate themselves from the ARM/x86 duopoly and gain autonomy in designing processors and cores. In that respect, RISC-V represent a unique opportunity for Chinese companies to develop their own cores and IP, and reshuffle the cards in the market. We wrote on extensive study of Chinese RISC-V ecosystem, from associations, universities, research centers as well as companies, in order to better understand who are the players of that ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Pierre Sel is a deputy representative of CEA in China, focusing on digital technologies. Relying on his background in Chinese studies as well as researcher, he joined CEA’s team in Beijing to conduct field work and in depth monitoring of the Chinese semiconductor industry and innovation landscape, in close coordination with the embassy other’s services.</em></p>

<h2 id="P-FRABOULET">European digital sovereignty and open source hardware: a perspective from French Research and Innovation</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/david-fraboulet-2149a39">David Fraboulet</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurent-crouzet-5ab404a5">Laurent Crouzet</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr">MESRI</a>/<a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid24148/www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid24148/direction-generale-de-la-recherche-et-de-l-innovation-d.g.r.i.html">DGRI</a>).</p>
<p>It becomes more and more difficult for a single country, even for a single continent, to keep control of the full panel of technologies necessary to master the industrial digital chain. From the lowest hardware tools necessary in a foundry (lithography etching, etc.), up to the more sophisticated high level software development, through all the successive design steps, one has to discriminate which ones are the most critical. It is our belief that the interaction between the chip hardware and the latest software developments (think for instance of IA) is very critical and will bring a huge competitive asset. This is why the capacity to design complex digital chips is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>The RISC V initiative should bring a fantastic opportunity for France, along with other European countries to develop state of the art processor design, in an open innovation frame well suited to the European cooperating philosophy, also adapted to our challenger position on these technologies, and allowing certification for critical systems. This thus appears as an excellent initiative that should bring, in an open-minded approach, commercial openings, as well as sovereignty.</p>

<h2 id="T-NIKHIL">Tutorial – An Introduction to the Official Formal Specification of the RISC-V ISA</h2>
<p>By <strong>Rishiyur S. Nikhil</strong> (<a href="https://bluespec.com">Bluespec, Inc.</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-14h00-Rishiyur-Nikhil.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>We present an overview of the official formal specification of the RISC-V ISA. RISC-V International has committed that this will be the official, definitive ISA spec, unlike previous ISAs where specs were text documents. It will be the standard for measuring functional correctness of all RISC-V implementations (including hardware cores, software simulators and emulators). The spec is ready for the base RV32 and RV64 ISAs, extensions M, A, F, D and C, and the privileged spec (User/ Supervisor/ Machine modes, and virtual memory). It will evolve to keep track of new extensions. It is written in Sail, an open-source domain specific language for ISA specs. Sail is engineered to be accessible to anyone familiar with text-style ISA specs. The spec is executable, by running it through the Sail compiler (written in OCaml), and is fast enough to boot Linux in minutes. The formal spec also opens up research into formally verified hardware implementations, compilers and simulators, and extensions for security and accelerators.</p>
<p><em>Rishiyur Nikhil chaired the technical group in the RISC-V Foundation that developed the RISC-V ISA formal spec. He is CTO and co-founder of Bluespec, Inc., which provides RISC-V cores and RISC-V system verification and development tools. Bluespec also developed the open-source BSV and BH High-Level Hardware Design Languages (HLHDLs), using ideas from Haskell and atomic transactions.</em></p>
<p><em>His degrees are from U. Pennsylvania (CS PhD) and IIT Kanpur (EE BTech). His interests and R&amp;D career (at MIT, Digital Equipment Corp. and some startups) span full systems, from formal methods and high-level programming languages to CPUs and system micro-architectures.</em></p>
<h2 id="P-DE-FERRIERE">A Compiler Approach to Cyber-Security</h2>
<p>By <strong>François de Ferrière</strong> (<a href="https://www.st.com">STMicroelectronics</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-15h00-Fran%C3%A7ois-de-Ferri%C3%A8re.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>We will present an implementation in the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> RISC-V compiler of software countermeasures against single fault or attack at execution time.</p>
<p>Our implementation, named <em>SecSwift</em>, proposes protections at the control-flow, data-flow and memory levels. Code is inserted to verify the correct execution of branch and call instructions, and the content of registers and memory is duplicated for specific resources. Checks are added at some points in the code to verify the correct execution of the program.</p>
<p>The insertion of countermeasures by the compiler compared to hand-written implementations has many advantages, including the activation of full compiler optimizations, a reduced development time and fine tuning of the protection level for performance and code size tradeoffs.</p>
<p>We will present our results on the qualification of these protections on applications, give figures on performance and code size impact, as well as showing annotations reported by the compiler to track protections from source code down to binary code.</p>
<p>These protections are already at production level and will be used in next products developed at STMicroelectronics to replace protections that were previously implemented by hand.</p>

<p><a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a> is a C compiler with a mathematical, machine-checked proof that the semantics of the assembly code produced matches that of the source code. It therefore avoids all middle-end bugs that occasionally crop up in the optimization phases of traditional compilers such as gcc. The mainline version of <a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a> targets x86, x86-64, PPC32, PPC64, ARM, AArch64, RiscV-32 and RiscV-64.</p>
<p>The mainline version of <a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a> does not schedule instruction according to processor pipeline constraints, which is very important for performance on in-order processors.</p>
<p>We have extended <a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a> with a <a href="https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/certicompil/compcert-kvx">backend for the Kalray KVX VLIW</a> processor, various optimizations (e.g. loop-invariant code motion), pre-pass scheduling for KVX, various Risc-V and AArch64 cores, and peephole optimizations plus post-pass scheduling for KVX and some AArch64 cores, with notable performance boost compared to mainline <a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a>.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce the general framework of formal proof of <a href="https://compcert.org">CompCert</a>, pre-pass and post-pass scheduling, and what kind of help we could get from core developers to improve performance.</p>

<h2 id="P-SCHERER">Why programming language research likes new architectures</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer">Gabriel Scherer</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a>). (<a href="./Media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-30-15h30-Gabriel-Scherer.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Programming language research is interested in the formal properties of programs and programming languages. Typically, this community studies either idealized languages with very nice properties but that are not usable in practice (lambda-calculi), or ugly languages with no nice properties that are useful to study because everyone uses them (Javascript). What is the relation with the design of a new instruction set?</p>
<p>In this talk we hope to give an overview of some research work and directions from the programming-language community that are relevant to instruction-set design and in general hardware/software interfaces. There is a strong interest in the programming-language community in getting strong, mathematical guarantees about program correctness; we show that is related to questions of secure execution on virtual or not-so-virtual machines, and that it opens the door for fruitful research in lower-level hardware/software systems.</p>
<p><em>Gabriel Scherer is a permanent researcher at INRIA Saclay, working at the intersection of programming languages and logic. Programming language research studies what can formally be said about programs and programming systems, and how the language in which they are implemented or specified influences these properties. Gabriel has worked in particular on the functional programming language OCaml, with interest in giving strong reasoning tools on programs, in particular to consider proving their correctness.</em></p>

<p>Before RISC-V, the direct interactions between CPU architects and operating systems architects have been very limited and mostly unidirectional. RISC-V has the ambition to bring these communities much closer to each other.</p>
<p>Besides other goals, some of the main goals of RISC-V are to be open and free (both as in <em>free beer</em> and as in <em>free speech</em>) for designers, users and manufacturers, with strong focus on robustness, safety and security. These goals are shared by the communities around open source microkernel-based operating systems.</p>

<p>In nowadays compute systems, power efficiency is achieved through specialization of some part of the application and implementation onto coarse grain heterogeneous components (CPU, GPU, TPU…). In such a system architecture, memory coherency becomes the new performance bottleneck. RISC-V cores, tightly coupled with accelerator, bring a unique architecture opportunity for mid grain scalable heterogeneous multi-cores sharing the same coherent memory hierarchy.</p>
<p>This talk will present scalable cache development made at CEA-LIST and its implementation onto 96-core processor with 6 Chiplets 3D-stacked on an Active Interposer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pulp-platform.org">Parallel-Ultra Low Power (PULP)</a> project started in 2013 and from the beginning we wanted to keep its development open source, but we did not know how. In 2015 RISC-V came along with its open ISA and the PULP platform (<a href="https://pulp-platform.org"><code>pulp-platform.org</code></a>) emerged from this serendipitous convergence. In this talk, I will look back and, based on seven different SoCs taped out over a seven years period, I will tell the story of how our open source HW approach based on the RISC-V ISA has shaped the way we work and produced exciting results in research and technology transfer. I will then focus on the future challenges and open problems.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project aims at developing European processor technology for High Performance Computing (HPC) and emerging application areas. Beyond leveraging ARM technology, an important objective of the project is to develop a fully owned implementation of a generic accelerator based on the RISC-V vector extension ISA. The goal of this talk is to describe the fundamental vision behind the design of such accelerator and its architectural features. I will report on the implementation status of the first version of the micro architecture. I will also present the software development vehicle (SDV) frameworks used to steer a holistic co-design approach including operating system and overall system software developments to homogenize the heterogeneous combination of different cores in the overall platform.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will attempt to determine whether high-performance is agnostic of the ISA, or if, on the contrary, the ISA should provide specific facilities if high-performance is to be attained. We will consider several well-known and less well-known techniques that are implemented in modern high-performance x86/ARM cores and attempt to determine if using the RISC-V ISA would facilitate, or, on the contrary, harden, the implementation of such techniques in the context of a flagship general purpose processor core.</p>

<h2 id="P-LOISEL">A dynamic, authenticated secure debug scheme on RISC-V cores</h2>
<p>By Frank Lhermet, <strong>Yann Loisel</strong> (<a href="http://www.sifive.com">SiFive</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-31-14h30-Yann-Loisel.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Security and testability to the platform are usually antinomic. Users and customers usually shall either choose for debug features or for security but both available look like impossible. Debug mechanisms shall not become attack paths.</p>
<p>The objective of the presented scheme is to be flexible and adapted to different use cases. Therefore, the main objective for this scheme is to authenticate the operator. For that reason, the use of cryptography is critical as cryptographic primitives enable various services. Furthermore, it paves the way to formally proving the security strength of the proposal. In order to ease this flexibility requirement, the solution is a mix of hardware and software mechanisms, where the software makes the various use cases possible without the need to modify the hardware. Finally, compliance with the RISC-V debug specifications is a key feature.</p>

<p>By <strong>Charlie Su</strong> (<a href="https://www.andestech.com">Andes Technology Corporation</a>).</p>
<p>With its open, modular and extensible ISA, RISC-V architecture is leading the innovations for all computing devices, in particular for the emerging applications of 5G, AIoT, Automotive, Networking and Storage. In this talk, we will look into RISC-V architecture support to accelerate data processing for applications ranging from audio, voice, image, to video, vision, communication and AI. The RISC-V P extension or packed SIMD/DSP targets for fixed-point computations for audio, voice, image and slow video while the RISC-V V or Vector extension aims for higher data-rate applications with both fixed-point and floating-point instructions. For those interested in pursuing the ultimate performance efficient for domain-specific architecture, RISC-V’s custom extensibility creates a whole new opportunity for innovations. We will also examine how to unlock such potential.</p>
<p><em>Dr Charlie Su is the cofounder, CTO and EVP of <a href="https://www.andestech.com">Andes</a>. He led Andes to develop processor IP solutions with its own ISA before adopting RISC-V 4 years ago. The annual volume of Andes-Embedded SoC has now surpassed 2 billion in 2020. Charlie spent over 12 years in the Silicon Valley at Sun, C-Cube, SGI/MIPS, and Intergraph. He made key contributions to successful processors such as the Sun multi-core multi-threading Ultrasparc processors, the C-Cube MPEG codec processors, the MIPS out-of-order R10K families, and the Intergraph Clipper VLIW processor. Before starting Andes in 2005, he led the processor IP development in Faraday Technology for 2 years.</em></p>

<p>Security in pervasive connected objects and Internet of Things, is a growing concern. This increasing demand comes with increasing constraints, which led to the development of a new generation of lightweight ciphers algorithms. These algorithms have been developed to allow efficient hardware implementations and their implementation on non specialised microprocessors often lacks efficiency, especially in terms of latency and throughput. This led us to investigate for ways to accelerate the execution of such algorithms on standard processors without implementing full dedicated hardware accelerators. We have chosen to extend the RISC-V ISA by adding a small number of instructions allowing the acceleration of a representative selection of Lightweight Block Ciphers. The majority of these instructions are generic and can be used with a large range of Lightweight Block Ciphers. We present a comparison between a pristine and a modified implementation of a RISC-V core for both area overhead and execution acceleration. For some algorithms, the results show a gain of up to 100x in terms of execution speed. We are currently analysing the security of our extension regarding side channel attacks and working on implementing protection.</p>

<h2 id="P-GUILLEY">Random Number Generation Management at RISC-V API Level</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.secure-ic.com/membre/sylvain-guilley/">Sylvain Guilley</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.secure-ic.com/">Secure-IC</a>, <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/guilley/">Telecom-Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.ens-paris.fr">ENS</a>). (<a href="./media/slides/3rd-RISC-V-Meeting-2021-03-31-15h15-Sylvain-Guilley.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>Security applications rely on trustworthy random numbers. For example, frequent needs are key generation, challenges for fresh session establishment, countermeasures against cyber-physical attacks, etc.</p>
<p>Still, a typical True Random Number Generator (TRNG) is a complex Intellectual Property (IP) block. It comprises a physical entropy source, a Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRBG) to smooth irregularities of the physical source, embedded tests and an error management module. It is paramount that these blocks are property configured and managed.</p>
<p>RISC-V International &quot;Crypto Task Group&quot; has been producing draft documents to simplify the TRNG interface. In this talk, I'll detail various benefits obtained by extending the RISC-V API to drive TRNGs: (1) Simple interfaces help prevent the application developers from shooting themselves in their foot by misuse of the TRNG IP; indeed, software development is made easier hence probability of inserting vulnerabilities is reduced. (2) Standardized interface foster independent implementation of some tests and DRBG, which allows to put more trust in the hands of the developer. (3) Some high-end certification schemes require mathematical evidence regarding the TRNG rationale, and the proposed RISC-V interface enables to pass such certifications.</p>
