<h2 id="TOMISCH">Driving Innovation: Evolving the Role of Software in the RISC-V Ecosystem Beyond Enablement</h2>
<p>By <strong>Philipp Tomsich</strong> (<a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>).</p>
<p>The software efforts for RISC-V are quickly moving beyond the pure enablement of the existing architecture, as the focus shifts to a software-driven evolution of the architecture supported by first-class performance modelling and analysis tools.</p>
<p>This presentation introduces some key initiatives to create a robust ecosystem for ISVs while unlocking the benefits of RISC-V’s mix-and-match approach to ISA customisation: these range from efforts to rescue the fragmentation by standardising platforms to the standardisation of an unified discovery mechanism that allows the dynamic discovery of value-added or vendor-specific functionality. We can catch a glimpse of future directions of software-directed ISA evolution as seen in the areas of new synchronization instructions (Zawrs), matrix-multiplication, conditional branchless operations, performance modelling and performance analysis.</p>
<p>/Dr Philipp Tomsich is the Founder and Chief Technologist of <a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>, an engineering consultancy focused on engineering performance solutions through compiler optimizations, runtime performance tuning, system-level optimization, and hard-<em>software co-engineering on the architectural and micro-architectural level. He supports the RISC-V mission as the Chair of the Software Horizontal Committee within RISC-V International, where he oversees the community involvement on Toolchains &amp; Runtimes and drives the standardization effort for Platforms. Philipp brings broad experience and expertise in runtime systems (including Java VMs, compilers, operating systems kernels, and static code analysis), high-assurance applications, secure/trusted boot, and embedded hardware. His earlier contributions to open-source compilers have been focussed on ARMv8 and, more recently, on RISC-V. He has worked on languages and compilers for multi-core systems for over twenty years, being involved in engineering projects for high-assurance government applications. His previous career includes his role as the Founder and CTO of Theobroma Systems (a Software and Hardware engineering company offering tailored and standard modular solutions for high-assurance computing, which Cherry GmbH acquired in Oct 2020), compiler engineering at Silicon Graphics, and consulting in banking and government IT. He has held teaching and research roles at the Vienna University of Technology, where he also graduated with a degree and a doctorate in Computer Science, with the title M.Sc. (Dipl.-Ing.). In Austria, Philipp is a recognized court-certified expert on embedded systems, low-level programming, programming languages, compilers, and performance. He is an active contributor to open-source projects during his entire career, including the GNU toolchains (GCC, binutils, and glibc), OpenSSL, and as a custodian (i.e., global reviewer and maintainer) on the U-Boot project. He manages engineering teams working on the GNU toolchain, Linux kernel, cryptographic libraries, LLVM optimization, and Embedded Rust.</em></p>
<h2 id="TOMISCH-HIMELSTEIN">Maturing the RISC-V Ecosystem: From Technology to Product</h2>
<p>By <strong>Philipp Tomsich</strong> (<a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>) and <strong>Mark Himelstein</strong> (<a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V International</a>).</p>
<p>RISC-V is quickly maturing to include solutions for embedded, datacenter, enterprise, automotive and mobile applications and are defining the use cases driving future innovation and increased adoption. The cost and flexibility of RISC-V to use a comprehensive set of instructions and customize the ISA extensions for implementers to deploy for individual markets and applications puts an emphasis on sharing between community members throughout a rapidly growing solution ecosystem without constraining the openness for customizations and innovation.</p>
<p>This presentation provides an overview of some existing software and ongoing key initiatives to enable adoption of RISC-V for ISVs, software distributions, and system vendors.</p>

<h2 id="KINDGREN">A CPU is Only as Good as its Ecosystem: Turning RISC-V CPUs into Systems with FuseSoC</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olofkindgren">Olof Kindgren</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.qamcom.com">Qamcom Technology AB</a>).</p>
<p>A great 20th century thinkers once said &quot;A CPU is only as good as its ecosystem&quot;. RISC-V provides us with a CPU but how can we turn that into systems more efficiently? The award-winning FuseSoC provides us with a tool for managing IP cores and combining them to create larger systems.</p>
<p>Being the most popular package manager for IP cores, there are already hundreds of FuseSoC-compatible cores available. Most high-profile open source silicon projects have already adopted FuseSoC or are looking at doing so, and it is being increasingly used for development of proprietary systems as well. With support for more than 30 different EDA tool flows it covers a wide range of work flows from synthesis to simulation to formal verification.</p>
<p>Sounds great, doesn't it? It sure does, and this presentation will take you through the basics of FuseSoC to help you get started and look at how FuseSoC can help you focus on your core business instead of your cores.</p>
<p><em>The award-winning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olofkindgren">Olof Kindgren</a> is a senior digital design engineer working for <a href="https://www.qamcom.com">Qamcom Research &amp; Technology</a>. He became actively involved with free and open source silicon through the OpenRISC project in 2011 and has since then worked on many <a href="https://www.fossi-foundation.org">FOSSi</a> projects with a special interest in tools and collaborations. Notable work include the award-winning FuseSoc IP core package manager; the award-winning SERV RISC-V CPU and SweRVolf, a reference platform for the SweRV CPU family. In 2015, he also co-founded FOSSi Foundation, a vendor-independent organization with the mission to promote and assist Open Source Silicon in academia, the industry and for hobbyists alike. In recent years he is also involved in the RVFPGA computer architecture course and serve as a RISC-V ambassador</em></p>
<h2 id="DAVIS">Building an Open HPC Ecosystem</h2>
<p>By <strong>John Davis</strong> (<a href="https://bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>Over that last 3 decades, we have witnessed a transition from closed software ecosystems being the foundation for HPC, enterprise, and business to open source software ecosystems based on Linux and other software in the stack. The combination of current technology trends, the slowing of Moore’s Law, and cost prohibitive silicon manufacturing inhibit significant power-performance gains by relying on traditional closed ecosystems, especially in HPC, technology pushed to the extreme. This new regime forces systems to be much more specialized to achieve the power-performance profiles required for a supercomputer. In the past, HPC has led the way forward, defining the bleeding edge of technology. HPC can do this again with open hardware, as it has done in software with adopting Linux and open source in general. The RISC-V ISA provides the open standard in HW to enable this open HPC ecosystem. Much like Arm, RISC-V can follow the same, now accelerated path from embedded/IoT to HPC. The RISC-V Special Interest Group for HPC is helping to define and build this ecosystem. This talk will highlight the SIG HPC efforts and some of the European R&amp;D efforts making RISC-V the future platform for HPC.</p>

<h2 id="GIELDA">Unlocking Open Source RISC-V SoC Verification</h2>
<p>By <strong>Michael Gielda</strong> (<a href="https://antmicro.com">Antmicro</a>).</p>
<p>While RISC-V has spawned a large number of open source core implementations and energized the open hardware and design tooling community, verification - a major element of any modern SoC design - is still primarily done with proprietary tooling, which prevents the collaborative approach to development we have seen in other areas. CHIPS Alliance takes the RISC-V mission beyond the CPU and into the SoC and tooling domains, and one of our key focus areas has been open source verification using Verilator. The effort, spearheaded by Antmicro, Western Digital and Google, has seen very good progress in the recent months. We will discuss the current capabilities, opportunities and the road ahead for this effort, including dynamic scheduling which is on the way to being merged into Verilator in the upcoming 5.X version, the UHDM SystemVerilog frontend as well as plans for supporting further SystemVerilog constructs and other HDL languages.</p>
