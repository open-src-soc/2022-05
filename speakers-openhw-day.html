<p>Questions &amp; answers by all speakers.</p>
<p>Any silicon chip is only as good as the software ecosystem which accompanies it. The software Task Group's mission is to drive the creation of this ecosystem for OpenHW Group processors. Not just developing key software elements needed, but also encouraging the growth of a thriving commercial community which can develop and maintain this software for the long term. In this session we'll hear about the four main pillars of our work: compilers, operating systems, IDEs and modeling. The presenters are the engineering leads for their projects. They will focus on the technology they are developing, and demonstrate the software in operation. We hope that having listened to these talks you will be inspired, not just to use the tools, but to join the collaborative teams from around the world who are developing them.</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="http://asic.ethz.ch/authors/Florian_Zaruba.html">Florian Zaruba</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org">OpenHW Group</a>).</p>
<p>In this talk, we will give an overview of the OpenHW CORE-V open-source embedded MCU and application class APU platforms. The CORE-V MCU is built around the CORE-V CV32E40P, a four-stage, in-order, embedded-class core with custom instruction set extension for DSP centric applications. Furthermore, the CORE-V MCU SoC comes with an FPGA prototyping flow for the widely used Digilent Genesys II board and a rich set of software development tools and toolchain support. Also, OpenHW will manufacture and make available our CORE-V MCU in Globalfoundries 22FDX together with an embedded FPGA from Quicklogic for custom logic such as accelerators. The CORE-V APU is built around the CORE-V CV64A6 a 6-stage, single issue, in-order CPU which implements the 64-bit RISC-V instruction set. It fully implements I, M, A and C extensions as specified in Volume I: User-Level ISA v2.3 as well as the draft privilege extension v1.10. It implements three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like operating system. The CORE-V APU comes with an FPGA prototyping flow for the widely used Digilent Genesys II board and a rich set of software development tools, toolchain support and bootable Linux image.</p>
