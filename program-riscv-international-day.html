<h2 id="TOMISCH">Driving Innovation: Evolving the Role of Software in the RISC-V Ecosystem Beyond Enablement</h2>
<p>By <strong>Philipp Tomsich</strong> (<a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>).</p>
<p>The software efforts for RISC-V are quickly moving beyond the pure enablement of the existing architecture, as the focus shifts to a software-driven evolution of the architecture supported by first-class performance modelling and analysis tools.</p>
<p>This presentation introduces some key initiatives to create a robust ecosystem for ISVs while unlocking the benefits of RISC-V’s mix-and-match approach to ISA customisation: these range from efforts to rescue the fragmentation by standardising platforms to the standardisation of an unified discovery mechanism that allows the dynamic discovery of value-added or vendor-specific functionality. We can catch a glimpse of future directions of software-directed ISA evolution as seen in the areas of new synchronization instructions (Zawrs), matrix-multiplication, conditional branchless operations, performance modelling and performance analysis.</p>
<p>/Dr Philipp Tomsich is the Founder and Chief Technologist of <a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>, an engineering consultancy focused on engineering performance solutions through compiler optimizations, runtime performance tuning, system-level optimization, and hard-<em>software co-engineering on the architectural and micro-architectural level. He supports the RISC-V mission as the Chair of the Software Horizontal Committee within RISC-V International, where he oversees the community involvement on Toolchains &amp; Runtimes and drives the standardization effort for Platforms. Philipp brings broad experience and expertise in runtime systems (including Java VMs, compilers, operating systems kernels, and static code analysis), high-assurance applications, secure/trusted boot, and embedded hardware. His earlier contributions to open-source compilers have been focussed on ARMv8 and, more recently, on RISC-V. He has worked on languages and compilers for multi-core systems for over twenty years, being involved in engineering projects for high-assurance government applications. His previous career includes his role as the Founder and CTO of Theobroma Systems (a Software and Hardware engineering company offering tailored and standard modular solutions for high-assurance computing, which Cherry GmbH acquired in Oct 2020), compiler engineering at Silicon Graphics, and consulting in banking and government IT. He has held teaching and research roles at the Vienna University of Technology, where he also graduated with a degree and a doctorate in Computer Science, with the title M.Sc. (Dipl.-Ing.). In Austria, Philipp is a recognized court-certified expert on embedded systems, low-level programming, programming languages, compilers, and performance. He is an active contributor to open-source projects during his entire career, including the GNU toolchains (GCC, binutils, and glibc), OpenSSL, and as a custodian (i.e., global reviewer and maintainer) on the U-Boot project. He manages engineering teams working on the GNU toolchain, Linux kernel, cryptographic libraries, LLVM optimization, and Embedded Rust.</em></p>
<h2 id="TOMISCH-HIMELSTEIN">Maturing the RISC-V Ecosystem: From Technology to Product</h2>
<p>By <strong>Philipp Tomsich</strong> (<a href="https://www.vrull.io">VRULL GmbH</a>) and <strong>Mark Himelstein</strong> (<a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V International</a>).</p>
<p>RISC-V is quickly maturing to include solutions for embedded, datacenter, enterprise, automotive and mobile applications and are defining the use cases driving future innovation and increased adoption. The cost and flexibility of RISC-V to use a comprehensive set of instructions and customize the ISA extensions for implementers to deploy for individual markets and applications puts an emphasis on sharing between community members throughout a rapidly growing solution ecosystem without constraining the openness for customizations and innovation.</p>
<p>This presentation provides an overview of some existing software and ongoing key initiatives to enable adoption of RISC-V for ISVs, software distributions, and system vendors.</p>

<h2 id="BAEHR">Open Source IC Design and Hardware Reverse Engineering Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Reverse Engineering RISC-V Designs</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/eisec/mitarbeiter/johanna-baehr/">Johanna Baehr</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.tum.de">TUM</a>).</p>
<p>Open source hardware design is no longer only a dream of academia, but finally also embraced in larger corporations as a secure, verifiable and affordable solution to hardware design. However, from a hardware security point of view, allowing everyone to understand everything about your design is not always the most secure choice. In particular when it comes to attacks on hardware, giving away too much design information not only allows an attacker to understand your chip, but also to easily influence or manipulate your chip. This talk will outline the interaction between open source hardware design and hardware reverse engineering methods, identify where attacks on the design are made possible, and discuss opportunities to increase the security when manufacturing with open source hardware.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/eisec/mitarbeiter/johanna-baehr/">Johanna Baehr</a> received her M.Sc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.tum.de">Technical University of Munich</a> in 2016, and has since been working as a research assistant in the area of Chip Reverse Engineering. Her expertise includes all things reverse engineering, with a focus on netlist interpretation and abstraction. Her interests also include Reverse Engineering Countermeasures, Hardware Trojans Insertion and Detection, and Supply Chain Security and IC Trust.</em></p>

<h2 id="DELLOW">RISC-V : Securing the Future of Open Source Computing</h2>
<p>By <strong>Andrew Dellow</strong> (<a href="https://huawei.com">Huawei</a>).</p>
<p>Security has often been a late consideration in the development of systems, hardware, and software. The emergence of exploits such as malware, trojans, the recent Spectre, Meltdown, RAMbleed attacks has resulted in serious financial and reputational losses. This illustrates the need to consider security as an essential component, directly built into a system rather than layered on top. RISC-V is a clean slate architecture with a unique opportunity to build in security as an intrinsic part of the hardware software and firmware.</p>
<p>This talk will describe the numerous initiatives and ongoing work to secure RISC-V and it’s ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Andrew is Chief Security Architect at <a href="https://huawei.com">Huawei Technologies Research and Development UK</a>, developing security architectures for Huawei’s Chipset business. Andrew has 20 years’ experience in system on chip security starting with the original development of robust Set Top Box SoCs for Pay TV, holding more than 40 patents in the area of SoC security. He is currently responsible for security strategy and architecture for device chipsets including IoT, TV, STB, IP Camera and connectivity chipsets. Andrew is the Chair of the RISC-V Security Horizontal Committee, helping to define the RISC-V security strategy and coordinating the many Technical and Special Interest Groups working on RISC-V security. Prior to joining Huawei in 2016, Andrew was a Distinguished Engineer and Technical Director at Broadcom Corp.</em></p>
<h2 id="QUEVREMONT">Introduction to RISC-V Functional Safety Special Interest Group</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jquevremont/">Jérôme Quévremont</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/global/innovation/research-and-technology">Thales</a>).</p>
<p>Functional safety is aimed at controlling and minimizing the risk of systems catastrophic failures (i.e. failures that can injure or damage people’s health, equipment or the environment). In the context of software-driven applications, meeting functional safety requires that functional and timing correctness of applications is guaranteed throughout the system lifetime. The Functional Safety special interest group (SIG-Safety) gathers RISC-V International members from various critical domains (automotive, space, aerospace…) and different profiles (OEMs, hardware, software and service providers, researchers…) willing to promote functional safety needs in processors and identifying gaps that can be solved by RISC-V International specifications. This talk will introduce SIG-Safety and its activities to a broader audience.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jquevremont">Jérôme Quévremont</a> graduated in telecommunications and electronics in 1995 (Télécom Bretagne, now IMT Atlantique).

<h2 id="KINDGREN">A CPU is Only as Good as its Ecosystem: Turning RISC-V CPUs into Systems with FuseSoC</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olofkindgren">Olof Kindgren</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.qamcom.com">Qamcom Technology AB</a>).</p>
<p>A great 20th century thinkers once said &quot;A CPU is only as good as its ecosystem&quot;. RISC-V provides us with a CPU but how can we turn that into systems more efficiently? The award-winning FuseSoC provides us with a tool for managing IP cores and combining them to create larger systems.</p>
<p>Being the most popular package manager for IP cores, there are already hundreds of FuseSoC-compatible cores available. Most high-profile open source silicon projects have already adopted FuseSoC or are looking at doing so, and it is being increasingly used for development of proprietary systems as well. With support for more than 30 different EDA tool flows it covers a wide range of work flows from synthesis to simulation to formal verification.</p>
<p>Sounds great, doesn't it? It sure does, and this presentation will take you through the basics of FuseSoC to help you get started and look at how FuseSoC can help you focus on your core business instead of your cores.</p>
<p><em>The award-winning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olofkindgren">Olof Kindgren</a> is a senior digital design engineer working for <a href="https://www.qamcom.com">Qamcom Research &amp; Technology</a>.

<h2 id="DAVIS">Building an Open HPC Ecosystem</h2>
<p>By <strong>John Davis</strong> (<a href="https://bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>Over that last 3 decades, we have witnessed a transition from closed software ecosystems being the foundation for HPC, enterprise, and business to open source software ecosystems based on Linux and other software in the stack. The combination of current technology trends, the slowing of Moore’s Law, and cost prohibitive silicon manufacturing inhibit significant power-performance gains by relying on traditional closed ecosystems, especially in HPC, technology pushed to the extreme. This new regime forces systems to be much more specialized to achieve the power-performance profiles required for a supercomputer. In the past, HPC has led the way forward, defining the bleeding edge of technology. HPC can do this again with open hardware, as it has done in software with adopting Linux and open source in general. The RISC-V ISA provides the open standard in HW to enable this open HPC ecosystem. Much like Arm, RISC-V can follow the same, now accelerated path from embedded/IoT to HPC. The RISC-V Special Interest Group for HPC is helping to define and build this ecosystem. This talk will highlight the SIG HPC efforts and some of the European R&amp;D efforts making RISC-V the future platform for HPC.</p>

<h2 id="GIELDA">Unlocking Open Source RISC-V SoC Verification</h2>
<p>By <strong>Michael Gielda</strong> (<a href="https://antmicro.com">Antmicro</a>).</p>
<p>While RISC-V has spawned a large number of open source core implementations and energized the open hardware and design tooling community, verification - a major element of any modern SoC design - is still primarily done with proprietary tooling, which prevents the collaborative approach to development we have seen in other areas. CHIPS Alliance takes the RISC-V mission beyond the CPU and into the SoC and tooling domains, and one of our key focus areas has been open source verification using Verilator. The effort, spearheaded by Antmicro, Western Digital and Google, has seen very good progress in the recent months. We will discuss the current capabilities, opportunities and the road ahead for this effort, including dynamic scheduling which is on the way to being merged into Verilator in the upcoming 5.X version, the UHDM SystemVerilog frontend as well as plans for supporting further SystemVerilog constructs and other HDL languages.</p>
<em>Michael Gielda is VP Business Development at <a href="https://antmicro.com">Antmicro</a>, Chair of Outreach for <a href="https://chipsalliance.org">CHIPS Alliance</a> and a Chair of Marketing for the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org">Zephyr Project</a>.
