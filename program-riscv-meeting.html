<h2 id="FRANCIS">Free RISC-V Systems: Benefits and Status of QEMU</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://github.com/alistair23">Alistair Francis</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.westerndigital.com">Western Digital</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> is an open source emulator that supports the RISC-V ISA. QEMU is extremely quick and provides a vast range of advanced features for users and developers. QEMU has been used in the past for software development, but as hardware become more available is it still as beneficial? This talk will present an introduction to QEMU and how it works. It will then describe how useful QEMU can be for developing for RISC-V, even as more hardware becomes available. This will include details about the current mainline status for QEMU, including vendor and draft extension support. It will also discuss the value of developing extensions using QEMU. The presentation can then end with some demonstrations and examples of using QEMU for RISC-V development.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/alistair23">Alistair Francis</a> currently works at Western Digital as part of the RISC-V software research team. He is the QEMU RISC-V maintainer; developing, reviewing and merging QEMU patches. He also has a focus on security, specifically secure operating systems related to Root of Trust (RoT) devices. He is the vice-chair of the RISC-V Security Response Team. He is actively working on supporting Tock and the Tock ecosystem on the OpenTitan platform. He also contributes to and maintains a range of different software projects, from low level operating systems to high level system applications. He has contributed to glibc, strace, OpeOCD, Oreboot, OpenEmbedded, Linux, Xvisor, OpenSBI, seL4, SweRV-ISS, Open Compute Project security specifications and a variety of other projects.</em></p>
<h2 id="KOSSIFIDIS">Demystifying the RISC-V Linux software stack</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkossifidis">Nick Kossifidis</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.ics.forth.gr">FORTH</a>/<a href="https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/">CARV</a>).</p>
<p>In the past few years since the initial RISC-V Linux port got merged in upstream Linux, multiple contributors from various companies and institutions have worked towards improving the code, supporting more features, and the new ISA extensions introduced by <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V International</a>. Supporting an architecture as modular as RISC-V, while also keeping track of relevant kernel updates and the rest of the system software stack can be a real challenge. In this talk we 'll try to demystify the RISC-V system software stack by providing an overview of the various elements and how the interact with each other, and provide an overview of the development process of the RISC-V Linux port. We'll focus on key kernel features that are currently supported, ongoing work on new features, and share our experience on contributing to the RISC-V system software stack as part of our work on the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickkossifidis">Nick Kossifidis</a> is a principal research engineer at the <a href="https://www.ics.forth.gr">FORTH</a> research center in Greece (at the CARV laboratory of the Institute of Computer Science), with extensive experience in networking, systems software, and security. He has worked as an IT security consultant and penetration tester for Fortune 500 companies on high profile projects, and is an active contributor on security and software related topics within the RISC-V technical committee and the RISC-V community in general. He is the current Chair of the RISC-V TEE TG, and recipient of a RISC-V 2021 Ratification award (on behalf of the TEE TG) and a RISC-V 2021 outstanding community contributor award. Nick has multiple contributions in open source projects, including various subsystems of the Linux kernel, and is currently working on the bringup, validation, and optimization process of various RISC-V prototypes of the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="FERRER">SW Toolchain for RISC-V Vector Extensions</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://rofi.roger-ferrer.org/">Roger Ferrer</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.bsc.es">BSC</a>).</p>
<p>The RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) provides vector capabilities to the RISC-V ecosystem. It does this by providing a very flexible and rich ISA which features vector length and masking support. This flexibility comes with some challenges in implementing it in compilers. In this talk we will see how we tackled these issues in the context of the EPI project, which ideas were ultimately implemented in upstream LLVM and which didn't. With code generation well understood now, the focus shifts on how to make good use of the extension in the compiler via vectorization. We will see the ongoing work in the LLVM Loop Vectorizer, what is there and what is still missing.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://rofi.roger-ferrer.org">Roger Ferrer Ibanez</a> is a research engineer at the <a href="https://www.bsc.es">Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)</a> who works on compilers. In the past he worked in enabling the parallel programming research in task based models at BSC. While he is still participating on this, these days most of his work revolves about enabling support for the RISC-V vector extension in LLVM in the context of the EPI, MEEP and EUPILOT projects.</em></p>
<h2 id="GIELDA">Springbok: Using Renode and IREE to prototype and develop ML models on RVV</h2>
<p>By <strong>Michael Gielda</strong> (<a href="https://antmicro.com">Antmicro</a>) and <strong>Adam Jesionowski</strong> (<a href="https://research.google">Google</a>).</p>
<p>Efficient ML development for low-power applications requires a tight control of the entire hardware/software/ML stack. To rapidly prototype different approaches, a simulation based workflow is very useful to explore tradeoffs and observe the behavior of the target (virtual) hardware. This talk will present an end-to-end flow for generating RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV)-based accelerators using the <a href="https://google.github.io/iree">IREE</a> machine learning library and testing them in the open source <a href="https://renode.io">Renode</a> simulation framework.</p>
<p><em>Michael Gielda is VP Business Development at <a href="https://antmicro.com">Antmicro</a>, Chair of Outreach for <a href="https://chipsalliance.org">CHIPS Alliance</a> and a Chair of Marketing for the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org">Zephyr Project</a>. He is involved in many open source software and hardware projects related to software-driven tools and methodologies, AI, FPGA &amp; ASIC development.</em></p>

<p>The emergence of open hardware initiatives, for instance based on the RISC-V ISA, exposes more easily the exact behavior of hardware designs. They can then be analyzed and combined with application-level semantics to formally verify complex safety and security properties at system level, in particular by integrating non-functional characteristics such as timing. This is the goal of the the LEAF approach developped at CEA, which currently focuses, on one hand, on timing predictability &amp; memory contention evaluations required by safety-critical systems, and on the other hand on assessments of fault-injection attacks over secured embedded systems. In this talk, we first briefly present an overview of LEAF. Then, we focus on our current results over several RISC-V case studies for: 1) fault-injection assessment, i.e. the CV32E40P processor from the <a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org">OpenHW Group</a>, and 2) the automatic construction of pipeline datapaths from high-level HDL code (RISC-V mini, Sodor, KyogenRV, Rocket).</p>

<p>High core counts and complex memory hierarchies are typically the staple of HPC architectures. This is often synonym to long delays and high implementation efforts when trying to make overall decisions regarding the flavor of a new architecture. This talk introduces Coyote, an open-source, execution-driven simulator based on Spike and Sparta, with a focus on the movement of data throughtout the modeled system. This focus strikes a balance between fidelity and simulation throughput, enabling reasoning on the RISC-V based HPC architectures of tomorrow.</p>

<p>By <strong>Andrea Bartolini</strong> (<a href="https://dei.unibo.it/en/department">Università di Bologna</a>) and <strong>Alessandro Ottaviano</strong> (ETHZ).</p>
<p>High-Performance Computing (HPC) processors are nowadays integrated Cyber-Physical Systems, which require Power Controller Subsystems (PCS) to provide advanced multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) dynamic control of operating points to meet energy, power and thermal constraints. In the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a>, a PCS IP has been designed to extend the <a href="https://pulp-platform.org">PULP platform</a> to comply with the industrial standards adopted in the HPC segment for on-chip, off-chip power management. The SoC is named PULPcontroller and features a fully-digital and highly capable RISC-V based parallel microcontroller IP optimized for power management of complex HPC processors. Its design supports a manager core and peripherals paired with a cluster of 8 processors to accelerate the Power Control Firmware workload, Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine for accessing on-chip sensors, a uDMA engine for off-chip AVSBUS/PMBUS peripheral support and BMC-based communication through the Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP). The controller implements basic System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) doorbell-based protocol hosting up to 144 external interrupt lines. On the software side, it relies on an open-source Real-time Operating System (<a href="https://www.freertos.org">FreeRTOS</a>) for agile scheduling of the underlying Control Policy and interface handling. The presentation will describe the power management problem, requirements, and the ControlPULP design and performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is a system for digital architecture design (FPGA, ASIC), which generates traditional HDL (VHDL, Verilog) from a high level, functional specification written in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Haskell</a>. A design can be fully developed and tested in software, while at the same time offering full control over detailed hardware issues. It has several features, such as higher order functions, domain specific embedded languages, polymorphism. In particular the typing system is very helpful in verification, including time domain crossings and synchronization. Last but not least, a design process in <a href="https://clash-lang.org">Clash</a> is fundamentally model based, meaning that all design steps, starting from an initial model, are expressed in the same language, and the correctness of each step is provable. During the talk we will illustrate some of these aspects by examples.</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~luca/">Luca Carloni</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>).</p>
<p>System-on-chip (SoC) architectures are increasingly heterogeneous, as they feature multiple general-purpose processor cores with many specialized hardware accelerators. The complexity of SoC design threatens to widen the gap between the capabilities provided by semiconductor technologies and the productivity of computer engineers. Open-source hardware is a promising avenue to address this challenge by enabling design reuse and collaboration. <a href="https://esp.cs.columbia.edu">ESP</a> is an open-source research platform for SoC design that combines a scalable tile-based architecture and a flexible system-level design methodology. With <a href="https://esp.cs.columbia.edu">ESP</a>, designers can rapidly prototype an SoC architecture with multiple RISC-V processor cores and dozens of loosely-coupled accelerators, all interconnected with a multiplane network-on-chip. The <a href="https://esp.cs.columbia.edu">ESP</a> methodology promotes system-level design while accommodating different specification languages and design flows. Conceived as a heterogeneous system integration platform, <a href="https://esp.cs.columbia.edu">ESP</a> is intrinsically suited to foster collaborative engineering across the open-source hardware community.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project aims at developing European processor technology for High Performance Computing (HPC) and emerging application areas. An important objective of the project is to develop a fully owned implementation of accelerators based on RISC-V cores. The resulting EPAC architecture integrates generic RISC-V vector cores plus other more specialized accelerator component (STX) also based on RISC-V targeting AI and stencil kernels acceleration plus a RISC-V processor (VRP) with support for variable and high precision arithmetic.</p>
<p>The talk will introduce the fundamental vision behind the design and the overall resulting architecture. The project has produced a test chip in GF 22 nm technology, featuring 4 vector cores, 2 STX clusters and one VRP processor. In parallel, an FPGA implementation of the vector core and memory subsystem has been implemented to be used as a software development vehicle (SDV), continuous integration (CI) and co-design support infrastructure. This system runs as stand alone self hosted Linux node where general purpose application from the HPC but also other domains can be run. I will report some initial results of these evaluations and comparisons to other state of the art architectures.</p>

<p>The availability of domain-specific instruction set extensions, like vector processing, make RISC-V a good candidate for supporting the integration of specialized hardware in processor cores. This talk presents Vitruvius, the first RISC-V vector accelerator developed at BSC for the Supercomputing domain, as part of the EPI project. Vitruvius implements the RISC-V vector extension specification V0.7.1. and can be easily connected to a scalar core using the Open Vector Interface (OVI) standard in a plug-and-play fashion. Vitruvius natively supports long vectors: 256 Double Precision (DP) floating-point elements in a single vector instruction. It is composed of a set of identical vector pipelines (lanes), each containing a slice of the Vector Register File (VRF) and functional units (one integer, one floating-point). It adopts a novel hybrid in-order/out-of-order execution scheme, supported by vector register renaming and arithmetic/memory instruction decoupling. When configured with eight vector lanes, Vitruvius reaches a maximum frequency of 1.25 GHz when synthesized using GLOBALFOUNDRIES 22FDX FD-SOI. The silicon implementation has a total area of 1.13 mm2 and total estimated power around 1W.</p>

<h2 id="FUGUET">VRP/VXP: VaRiable eXtended Precision RISC-V Accelerator for High-Precision</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-fuguet-tortolero-9769a21b">César Fuguet-Tortolero</a></strong> (<a href="http://www-list.cea.fr">CEA</a>).</p>
<p>Algebraic linear solvers and eigensolvers are ubiquitous in several scientific domains such as structure calculations, fluidics or finite elements. For this reason, they are proposed in mature standard and commercial libraries. Projective methods are the most popular methods for implementing both linear solvers and eigensolvers because of their scalable memory cost O(N). However, these methods are highly sensitive to numerical stability. The use of high precision (more than 128 bits) floating-point computation increases this stability and reduces the number of iterations. Current proposals for implementing high-precision computation consist in software emulation, which exhibits poor performance.</p>
<p>The CEA-List proposal is a hardware accelerator for high-precision computing. We developed the hardware VaRiable eXtended Precision (VRP/VXP) RISC-V accelerator that operates on floating-point numbers with up to 512 bits of significand and 18 bits of exponent. Both software and hardware topics will be discussed during the presentation.</p>
<p>Work on this accelerator has been founded first by the French Research National Agency (ANR) in the framework of the <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-18-CE46-0011">IMPRENUM</a> project, and then by the <a href="https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu">European Processor Initiative (EPI)</a> project.

<h2 id="PRIKRYL">Customizing RISC-V designs to unlock innovation with Codasip</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zdenek-prikryl/">Zdeněk Přikryl</a></strong> (<a href="https://github.com/SpinalHDL">Codasip</a>).</p>
<p>For many years, the semiconductor industry has benefited from shrinking process nodes to improve performance while reducing cost and power. But our industry can no longer rely on smaller silicon geometries to achieve computational improvements. Instead, we are in a world where performance, power, and price advantages must come from the architecture. With many and varied possible specialized processor architectures, processor design automation is essential to ensure that design cycles are short and cost effective. This talk discusses how Codasip enables techniques such as domain specific acceleration, heterogenous compute and HW-SW co-design. We will go through case studies that show how RISC-V designs were customized for computational workloads in different domains with <a href="https://codasip.com/products/codasip-studio/">Codasip Studio</a>.</p>

<p>RISC-V system-on-chips are devices built around one or more CPUs that implementes the RISC-V ISA. Thanks to RISC-V, the development of many open-source IPs, targetting different PPA figures and targets are now available for free. However, relying on open-source IPs may sound risky when targeting production-volume chips. <a href="https://www.openhwgroup.org">OpenHW Group</a> is building open-source, permissive, fully featured RISC-V IPs (called <a href="https://github.com/openhwgroup">CORE-V</a>) that cover the market needs extensively, from low-end, low-cost microcontrollers to application-class, Linux capable IPs. In this talk, we address the OpenHW Group CORE-V roadmap, which IPs we have built with industrial-quality verification and what is coming soon. We show which IP suits best your application and what useful related IPs and specification are available.</p>

<p>Thales leads the <a href="https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6">CVA6</a> project at the OpenHW Group, to transform ETH Zürich and University of Bologna’s ARIANE famous RISC-V application core into an industrial-grade core available as open-source for the community. From the original 64-bit ARIANE design, renamed CV64A6 by OpenHW, Thales has designed a 32-bit flavor, named CV32A6, a resource-optimized version for embedded applications that need to support rich OSes like Linux. The CV32A6 exists in two versions: one optimized for ASIC design and one as a vendor-independent FPGA soft core. Both cores share the same configurable source code, written in SystemVerilog. Among other tasks, the <a href="https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6">CVA6</a> project includes industrial-grade verification, performance and resource optimizations, the addition of an extension interface and the support of recent Linux versions. This talk will introduce the <a href="https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6">CVA6</a> features, the project goals and the recent achievements.</p>

<h2 id="MOORE">Intro to CHERI capability-based memory protection</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~swm11/">Simon W. Moore</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Univ. of Cambridge</a>).</p>
<p>Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>) is a security extension of conventional Instruction Set Architectures that adds capabilities – unforgeable and bounded tokens. A capability is a fat pointer containing the address and metadata, including permissions and bounds. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> enforces spatial safety, enables temporal safety, and supports fine-grained software compartmentalization. This talk will introduce foundational <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> concepts along with their motivations and constraints. We will review key historical design points which have led to current <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> incarnations, and finish with a look into the future of commercial <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> adoption.</p>

<h2 id="WOODRUFF">The CHERI-RISC-V experimental extension</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdw57/">Jonathan Woodruff</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Univ. of Cambridge</a>).</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> RISC-V extension.]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> brings unforgeable fat pointers, aka capabilities, into the instruction set. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> was originally developed as an extension to the MIPS instruction set, and we have now developed a second-generation <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> extension for the RISC-V instruction set. CHERI-RISC-V moves to a unified register file, where integer registers are extended to hold capabilities. This naturally enables existing loads and stores to use capability addresses, saving encoding space and improving comparability between capability and traditional executables. CHERI-RISC-V also naturally extends all address CSRs to capabilities and adds a few additional capabilities to constrain capability-oblivious executables. We review design choices with their justifications, setting the stage for eventual discussions toward a ratified extension.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdw57/">Jonathan Woodruff</a> is a Senior Research Associate with expertise in processor architecture and microarchitecture as well as low-level software optimisation. Specialising in capability processor design, he has pushed into full-system optimisations including cache hierarchy, core timing, and multi-core designs as well as explorations into major security approaches including control flow integrity and private execution.</em></p>
<h2 id="RUGG">Four CHERI RISC-V micro-architectures</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/pdr32">Peter Rugg</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Univ. of Cambridge</a>).</p>
<p>After the successful initial implementation of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> on a MIPS processor, RISC-V offered the ideal platform to bring <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> more actively to the research community. We augment four microarchitectures with the security extension: Bluespec Inc’s Piccolo, Flute, and Toooba (based on MIT’s RiscyOO), and lowRISC’s Ibex core. These implementations span the processor space from small area-sensitive microcontrollers to large out-of-order superscalar designs. This has allowed concrete investigation of the ISA design-space, software experimentation and given early ideas of FPGA power, performance and area overheads of supporting capabilities in different points on the processor design-space.</p>

<h2 id="RICHARDSON">Software Ecosystem: QEMU, LLVM, CheriBSD</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/alr48">Alexander Richardson</a></strong> (Google, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Univ. of Cambridge</a>).</p>
<p>The long-running <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> project has produced an extensive collection of software and support tools. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-LLVM can compile the vast majority of C and C++ programs to pure-capability executables to run on <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-RISC-V, as well as other <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> architectures. <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-LLVM warnings and errors have been matured over many development cycles to ease the transition to dynamic memory safety enforcement, and several angles of more aggressive enforcement are available through compiler flags. Development is often eased using QEMU with <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-RISC-V support for quickly testing changes. CheriBSD on <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-RISC-V is routinely run with all user-space executables in pure-capability mode, and the kernel itself can also be compiled as a pure-capability executable. CheriBSD also implements Cornucopia temporal memory safety service for pure-capability executables. While <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>-RISC-V has been a research platform, its software ecosystem is relatively mature and useful for general development.</p>

<h2 id="FUCHS">Demo: Detecting and Resolving an Exploit under CheriBSD on a Multi-core, Superscalar Softcore</h2>
<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/faf28">Franz Fuchs</a></strong> (<a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk">Univ. of Cambridge</a>).</p>
<p>We will tour the differences that <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a> introduces the familiar workflow of compiling and debugging programs. We will begin with displaying the properties of pointers on riscv64 versus a pure-capability application binary interface (ABI), and proceed to a demonstration of distinguishing pointers from data at runtime, despite identical values. We will then demonstrate the dynamic detection of a stack buffer overflow with the GDB tooling to characterise the failure. Finally we will demonstrate the extensive compiler warning support to aid in porting applications to the pure-capability ABI.</p>
